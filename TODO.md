# TODO

* Add a timestamp when a branch was created and always sort the tree based on the branch timestamp
* Bug: CI status shows as passing when it's still running
* Bug: `gh pr merge` deleting local branch breaks `yas sync`
* Show PR as MERGED in status
* Don't allow `yas add` when it's already added, except with --force. Use move instead.
* Parallel operations where possible:
    -> Annotation
    -> Submit? Can we do a git push in parallel?
* Add commit command that summarises the PR using AI
